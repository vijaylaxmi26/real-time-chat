## General info

This is a real-time chat where we can send the message to any active user to any device anywhere.
I build it with the help of socket.io library. on the front of the screen, 
there is a button clicking on that it will ask your user name in a prompt box. 
after it the chat box will pop up and u can chat with all the device who is connected to the server. 
socket.io broadcast the message to all the user.
